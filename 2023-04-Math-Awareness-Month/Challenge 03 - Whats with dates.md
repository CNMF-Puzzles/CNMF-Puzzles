## Always with the riddles, but sometimes its just a matter of sinking your teeth into the problem...

### Challenge:
```
Now two years and two months ago
Our game did you last undergo
  Now we’re back for another
  Oh why would you bother
You won’t solve this one, don’t you know?
The start is not hard as before
Listen now go write down your score
  Add in a couple above
  We are surely close enough
When we divide by three and four
There is one more thing you should know
We’ve been a bit slow to hit go
  We blew past our date
  While we tested fate
Go now! Let’s get on with the show!
```
